## PROBLEM STATEMENT

## DESCRIPTION

Created a to-do list application where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. Each task was represented as an object with attributes like task name, due date, and priority.

## ATTRIBUTES

Attributes" refers to the properties or characteristics of an object. These attributes can be variables or methods associated with an object.

Variables: Attributes can store data specific to the object. These variables can be of any data type such as integers, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.

Methods: Attributes can also be methods, which are functions that are defined within a class and can be called on instances of that class. Methods can operate on the data stored in the object's attributes.

Attributes in Python are accessed using dot notation (object.attribute_name).

Attributes are fundamental to object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. They encapsulate the state of an object and define its behavior through methods. This allows for better organization, reusability, and modularity in code
